Claims of patents must be read thoroughly. If you see only very few suppliers of a certain product then it may indicate it is patented.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>The patent can be divided into two types:<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Utility Patent:<\/strong> A utility patent is a patent that covers the creation of a new or improved\u2014and useful\u2014product, process, or machine. We do not go for products having utility patents.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Design Patent:<\/strong> A design patent is a form of the legal protection of the unique visual qualities of a manufactured item. There is a chance of going into those products but you have to change the design by 40 %.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Sourcing and Logistics<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy UPC from an authentic website, usually, a speedy barcode is used or get UPC exemption to save money.<\/li>\n<li>Make dummy Listing and open case from Amazon, three-time in different times to inquire whether my product is gated or not. You can use the image of the supplier and simple content will suffice. After successful product hunting and patent checking, we move towards sourcing our products. We also see the bad reviews of the product and especially of our competitor so that later on we can convey improvements to our seller. Usually, we use China for sourcing because it is cheaper. First, take rough estimates from suppliers about your product, you can use RFQ, if your margin comes up around 25 % then proceed, otherwise search for other countries or leave the product. Following are the platforms that are available to us:<\/li>\n<li>Alibaba<\/li>\n<li>AliExpress<\/li>\n<li>Made-In-China<\/li>\n<li>Local Sourcing Agent<br \/>\nCriteria for Selecting Supplier from Alibaba<\/li>\n<li>Ideally should be at least 4 years old seller.<\/li>\n<li>Must have a trade agreement.<\/li>\n<li>At least 3 gems.<\/li>\n<li>Response rate &gt; 80 %.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Finalizing seller and some tips:<\/strong>\u00b7<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Shortlist at least 10 suppliers, fulfilling the criteria above.<\/li>\n<li>You can use WhatsApp or WeChat to have a more personalized experience.<\/li>\n<li>Start negotiating with them.<\/li>\n<li>Start with the less amount of product then gradually increase volume and see price.<\/li>\n<li>When showing pictures to the supplier, remove the logo of the product from the picture.<\/li>\n<li>Order samples from 2 or 3 best suppliers while simultaneously ordering your product from your competitor. Once you have the sample, critically analyze it, you can use a drop test or ask an expert about the product.<\/li>\n<li>Compare the quality of products with the quality of competitors. Then finally select the competitor having a similar quality to the competitor and lower price.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure that the packaging is done according to your competitor.<\/li>\n<li>Place the order.<\/li>\n<li>Use trade assurance or Paypal to make payments<\/li>\n<li>Usually 30 % is given in advance and 70 % after production.<\/li>\n<li>Contact freight forwarder according to criteria as given for the seller.<\/li>\n<li>You have to give 100 % upfront.<\/li>\n<li>You can choose FOB, EXW, or DDP. However, it is a good practice to go for FOB so that the third part can be involved, and it is usually cheaper because the Chinese government may give some rebates over it.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure that the master carton is of the exact size specified by the supplier, you can also take sign from the freight forwarder.<\/li>\n<li>In the meantime, while an order is manufactured, start working on listing optimization.<\/li>\n<li>You can also ask the supplier to show them the product during production and after production via video call or you can employ a third party for inspection. Furthermore, you can also ask the actual address of the industry and then tell him that my relative may visit there, just to have some impact on the mind of a supplier.<\/li>\n<li>Plan for the inventory keeping in mind the giveaways.<\/li>\n<li>Generate two labels: shipping labels and product labels.<\/li>\n<li>Usually products weighing greater than 500 g are considered ocean products.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Listing optimization:<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>While the manufacturing is taking place, start with the listing optimization.<\/li>\n<li>Use 3d images with white background, infographics, and lifestyle images.<\/li>\n<li>Your product must cover at least 80 % of the image.<\/li>\n<li>Hire professional freelancers for these services.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure that all the main keywords are indexed in the listing. Hire some professional content writer for this purpose. You can also use scribble tool in helium to optimize the listing.<\/li>\n<li>Do backend optimization of listing and use Browse Tree Guide (BTG) for selecting search word, platinum keyword, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Check for the listing of main competitor and best seller on Amazon in this niche.<\/li>\n<li>BeginnersFba has many steps to follow, it takes 2 to 4 months to follow all the steps and launch a great product.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>This is how we are working for our clients from all over the world.

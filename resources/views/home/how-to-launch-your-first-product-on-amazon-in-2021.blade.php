                                    thoroughly. If you see only very few suppliers of a certain product then it

                            <h4><strong>The patent can be divided into two types:</strong></h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Utility Patent:</strong> A utility patent is a patent that covers
                                    the creation of a new or improved—and useful—product, process, or machine.
                                    We do not go for products having utility patents.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Design Patent:</strong> A design patent is a form of the legal protection
                                of the unique visual qualities of a manufactured item. There is a chance of
                                going into those products but you have to change the design by 40 %.</p>
                            <h4><strong>Sourcing and Logistics</strong></h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Buy UPC from an authentic website, usually, a speedy barcode is used or get
                                    UPC exemption to save money.</li>
                                <li>Make dummy Listing and open case from Amazon, three-time in different times
                                    to inquire whether my product is gated or not. You can use the image of the
                                    supplier and simple content will suffice. After successful product hunting
                                    and patent checking, we move towards sourcing our products. We also see the
                                    bad reviews of the product and especially of our competitor so that later on
                                    we can convey improvements to our seller. Usually, we use China for sourcing
                                    because it is cheaper. First, take rough estimates from suppliers about your
                                    product, you can use RFQ, if your margin comes up around 25 % then proceed,
                                    otherwise search for other countries or leave the product. Following are the

                                <li>Start negotiating with them.</li>
                                <li>Start with the less amount of product then gradually increase volume and see
                                    price.</li>
                                <li>When showing pictures to the supplier, remove the logo of the product from
                                    the picture.</li>
                                <li>Order samples from 2 or 3 best suppliers while simultaneously ordering your
                                    product from your competitor. Once you have the sample, critically analyze
                                    it, you can use a drop test or ask an expert about the product.</li>
                                <li>Compare the quality of products with the quality of competitors. Then
                                    finally select the competitor having a similar quality to the competitor and
                                    lower price.</li>

                                <li>You can choose FOB, EXW, or DDP. However, it is a good practice to go for
                                    FOB so that the third part can be involved, and it is usually cheaper
                                    because the Chinese government may give some rebates over it.</li>

                                    inspection. Furthermore, you can also ask the actual address of the industry
                                    and then tell him that my relative may visit there, just to have some impact
                                    on the mind of a supplier.</li>
